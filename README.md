# Experiments on uncertain pagerank

Student project with some experiments on different methods to compute PageRank on uncertain graphs, based on _Personalized PageRank in Uncertain Graphs with Mutually Exclusive Edges_ by Junghyun Kim, Maolin Li, Kasim Sel√ßuk Candan and Maria Luisa Sapino (see [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3077136.3080794)).
